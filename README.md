# NBA Basketball Season Stats Chrome Extension

[Extension live][chrome]

**This is a chrome extension that allows users to pull up a current NBA player's season stats on any web page without needing to redirect to a dedicated webpage.
To look up a player, select a player's name in text on the webpage, right-click the selection, and select the extension command. This will append a div element to the right side of the page that will fetch the player's data. If you select a different player on the same page afterward, it will delete the first div and replace it.

*Note : As this extension web-scrapes from www.basketball-reference.com, a public website, secure websites will block the get request made by the user. In these instances, the div generated by the extension will suggest you to go to that player's page on basketball-reference.com instead. The div will also display errors if a player's name isn't found or if that player has not played in the current 2016-2017 NBA season.
